# p2p-viz : a p2p network visualizer


## Build and run the app

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run start http
```
Open a browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000.

Select `Geolocation`.

When asked to load a state file, use `p2p-viz/dist/client/data/state.json`.

## Keyboard Interface

- the arrow keys move the camera
- the I and O keys do zoom **in** and **out**
- the C key cycles the color mode:  degree, betweenness, closeness
- the F key toggles the FPS display
- the G key toggle the gradient display
- the H key toggle the histogram display
- the N key toggles the connections, if a node or subnode is selected.


When you click on a node, it will turn white.  Metadata will be displayed in the upper right corner.

Aggregates of nodes that exist at the same geolocation (e.g, same ISP) are displayed as a `supernode`, and rendered as a magenta cube.  If selected, they may be clicked again to open up, displaying the corresponding `subnodes`.

## State Data

The app serves up a `state.json` file, a sample version being located in `dist/client/data`.  This file gets generated by the crawler data cruncher application (https://github.com/runziggurat/crunchy)
